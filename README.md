**Senior Software Engineer: Cisco International Ltd, SPVSS-CE Division (formerly NDS Ltd).**<br>
I was originally appointed as a Senior Software Integration Engineer with NDS in Staines, UK. My Initial responsibilities included integration and stabilisation of new features and new releases of STB middleware for BSkyB, the largest and most important and innovative customer of NDS. In 2013, NDS was acquired by Cisco, and was incorporated into the SPVSS Custom Engineering division.<br>
I remained in the SI (System Integration) team for about two years, a large chunk of which I was responsible for an investigation and audit of all of the Open Source and 3rd party contributors in the code base. at which time an opportunity opened in the development team. My responsibilities here were component-owner of the HTTP and HTTPSERVER components of the STB middleware, as well as general development and debugging of any other component as and when required. During this time Cisco made a move to an Agile, git, Gerrit approach and away from the more traditional waterfall approach using the Rational Cleacase/Clearquest tools. Under the new structure, the concept of “component-owner” was replaced by “feature teams” which were responsible for taking features through the full lifecycle of each new feature technical design, development, integration, component testing and full stack testing, and “Guilds” to offer specific technical expertise when required.<br>
