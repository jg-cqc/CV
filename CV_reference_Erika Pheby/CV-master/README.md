I am a software developer based in London. I recently graduated with a degree in Philosophy and Psychology from the University of Oxford and then pursued programming at Makers Academy, where I became passionate about JavaScript and clean, modular, test-driven code. I am seeking an entry-level developer role with extensive learning opportunities and preferably at a company that provides really good snacks. I love contributing to the communities that I am involved in, as well as doing volunteer work whenever I can! I'm a neuroscience and artificial intelligence buff and am keen to learn more about and potentially work in AI.
